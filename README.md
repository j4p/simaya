## Simaya
This Repository is Forked from [Snipe-IT](https://github.com/snipe/snipe-it) (Open Source Software for IT Asset Management)

Snipe-IT is actively developed and we [release quite frequently](https://github.com/snipe/snipe-it/releases). ([Check out the live demo here](https://snipeitapp.com/demo/).)

It is built on [Laravel 6](http://laravel.com).
__This is web-based software__. This means there is no executable file (aka no .exe files), and it must be run on a web server and accessed through a web browser. It runs on any Mac OSX, flavor of Linux, as well as Windows, and we have a [Docker image](https://snipe-it.readme.io/docs/docker) available if that's what you're into.
